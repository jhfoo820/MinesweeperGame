Minesweeper Game
A classic Minesweeper game built using Java Swing for the GUI. The objective is to uncover all non-mined squares while avoiding the mines. The game is a fun and engaging puzzle that challenges your logic and memory.

Description
This project is a graphical implementation of the Minesweeper game using Java. It features a grid of clickable squares, each square revealing either a number (indicating the number of adjacent bombs) or a bomb (resulting in a game over). The game board is fully interactive and built using Java's Swing library for the graphical user interface.

Features
Interactive Grid: Clickable squares reveal either a number or a bomb.

Bombs: Randomly placed bombs across the grid. Click a bomb, and you lose the game.

Numbers: Each square with a number indicates how many bombs are adjacent to it.

Win Condition: Uncover all non-mined squares to win.

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jhfoo820/MinesweeperGame.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd MinesweeperGame

Compile the Java files:
javac *.java

The game window should appear, and you can start playing!

How to Play
